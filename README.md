# DSA-Code
A repository for all my learnings in Data Structures and Algorithms

## Background
Since I'll be trying to tutor some acquaintances and friends for this subject, I thought it best to open up a public repository where I can store my code for specific data structures and algorithms. 

This will serve as a way for me to strengthen my existing knowledge, as well as provide source code for anyone looking to learn along.


## Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of the C programming language.
2. A C compiler, like GCC, installed on your system.
3. Access to a text editor or an IDE.

## Usage
After that, you may use a text editor or an IDE of your choice (I recommend Visual Studio Code) to start coding in C.

OR

You may use an online compiler, which is less of a hassle to get set up. 

Whatever gets you started the quickest is the best option, as this code is mostly for learning theory, we're not attempting to build complex applications.


## Contributing
If you find yourself wanting to add/improve upon this code, always feel free to do so. Any contributions are greatly appreciated!

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. 

You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement". 

### Steps to contribute 
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b [feature]/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request
